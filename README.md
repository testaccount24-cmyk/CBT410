//***FILE 410 contains the load modules associated with the         *   FILE 410
//*           MXI package from Rob Scott, of Rocket Software.       *   FILE 410
//*           The MXI package is a type of system monitor that      *   FILE 410
//*           can run under ISPF, in batch, or it can be invoked    *   FILE 410
//*           under REXX.  MXI is an extremely powerful program     *   FILE 410
//*           that can tell you very much about your MVS operating  *   FILE 410
//*           system, how it is set up, and what is running on      *   FILE 410
//*           it.  Card-image members (panels, and more) which      *   FILE 410
//*           are necessary to run this package, are on File 409.   *   FILE 410
//*                                                                 *   FILE 410
//*           For more detailed description of this package, see    *   FILE 410
//*           the documentation under File 409, and the members     *   FILE 410
//*           starting with "$" in File 409 itself.                 *   FILE 410
//*                                                                 *   FILE 410
//*           Important note:  If you are running z/OS 2.3 or       *   FILE 410
//*                            higher, please use the TXI load      *   FILE 410
//*                            module, and not the MXI load         *   FILE 410
//*                            module.                              *   FILE 410
